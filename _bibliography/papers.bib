  title = {Understanding the Unintended Effects of Human-Machine Moderation in Addressing Harassment within Online Communities},
  abstract = {We set out to explore the unintended effects of human-machine moderation in mitigating harassment within online communities. We examine communities that use a block-list type bot to prevent harassment from the source of harassment. Drawing from social categorization and selective exposure theories, we theorize that employing a machine alongside humans for community moderation will create unintended adverse effects. Specifically, within the moderated focal community, we hypothesize an emboldening effect characterized by an increase in harassment among community members directed at their outgroup members. Additionally, we expect a disengaging effect, that is, a downward trend in the focal community’s membership. Finally, in neighboring communities that share the same topic of discussion, we expect a spillover effect, that is, an increase in harassment. Employing Detoxify, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model, we evaluate harassment scores in the focal community by analyzing 4 million Reddit comments across various communities. These scores serve as inputs for Bayesian Structural Time Series analysis, revealing evidence for both disengaging and spillover effects. For the emboldening effect, we use community-specific keywords in a predefined computer-assisted document classification approach, Keyword Assisted Topic Model (keyATM), to identify the target of harassment. We use mean comparison and regression discontinuity to assess the change in the level of harassment targeting outgroup members before and after the human-machine moderation implementation.},

  title = {Innovation Cascades: Amazon Headquarter 2 's Impact on Local Innovation Activities},
  abstract = {Traditionally, geographical proximity is known to facilitate knowledge flows due to the physical presence of firms. Our study highlights a key finding: knowledge spillovers can begin at the announcement of a new entrant, even before its physical arrival. We apply the attention-based view of the firm to explain and predict how local firm{s'} anticipation of the new entrant leads to changes in their innovation activities. Using Amazo{n's} expansion to Crystal City, VA as a case study, we analyze how local firm{s’} anticipation of this entry affects local innovation. Our results demonstrate that Amazon's expansion positively impacts local innovation activities, highlighting the significance of anticipation in knowledge spillovers.},

%%  title = {The spillover of novel patents},
%%  abstract ={We applied our newly-constructed {patent’s} novelty measurement to estimate the effect of patent novelty on citation. We use the {patent’s} 1,024 document features as control variables for our estimation, which calls for a method that can reduce the dimensions of control variables. Specifically, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP), Double LASSO, and partialing-out LASSO. As our dataset is panel data, we used fixed effects (assignee and month fixed effects) in all of our analyses. All our results are consistent and suggest that novelty has a quadratic relationship with citation. Either too high or too low novelty might not lead to a high number of citations, a proxy for knwoledge spillover.},
