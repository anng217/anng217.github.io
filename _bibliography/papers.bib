%%  title = {The spillover of novel patents},
%%  abstract ={We applied our newly-constructed {patent’s} novelty measurement to estimate the effect of patent novelty on citation. We use the {patent’s} 1,024 document features as control variables for our estimation, which calls for a method that can reduce the dimensions of control variables. Specifically, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP), Double LASSO, and partialing-out LASSO. As our dataset is panel data, we used fixed effects (assignee and month fixed effects) in all of our analyses. All our results are consistent and suggest that novelty has a quadratic relationship with citation. Either too high or too low novelty might not lead to a high number of citations, a proxy for knwoledge spillover.},
