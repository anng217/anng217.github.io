  title = {Understanding the Unintended Effects of Human-Machine Moderation in Addressing Harassment within Online Communities},
  abstract = {We set out to explore the unintended effects of human-machine moderation in mitigating harassment within online communities. We examine communities that use a block-list type bot to prevent harassment from the source of harassment. Drawing from social categorization and selective exposure theories, we theorize that employing a machine alongside humans for community moderation will create unintended adverse effects. Specifically, within the moderated focal community, we hypothesize an emboldening effect characterized by an increase in harassment among community members directed at their outgroup members. Additionally, we expect a disengaging effect, that is, a downward trend in the focal community’s membership. Finally, in neighboring communities that share the same topic of discussion, we expect a spillover effect, that is, an increase in harassment. Employing Detoxify, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model, we evaluate harassment scores in the focal community by analyzing 4 million Reddit comments across various communities. These scores serve as inputs for Bayesian Structural Time Series analysis, revealing evidence for both disengaging and spillover effects. For the emboldening effect, we use community-specific keywords in a predefined computer-assisted document classification approach, Keyword Assisted Topic Model (keyATM), to identify the target of harassment. We use mean comparison and regression discontinuity to assess the change in the level of harassment targeting outgroup members before and after the human-machine moderation implementation.},

  title = {Innovation Cascades: Amazon Headquarter 2 's Impact on Local Innovation Activities},
  abstract = {Traditionally, geographical proximity is known to facilitate knowledge flows due to the physical presence of firms. Our study highlights a key finding: knowledge spillovers can begin at the announcement of a new entrant, even before its physical arrival. We apply the attention-based view of the firm to explain and predict how local firm{s'} anticipation of the new entrant leads to changes in their innovation activities. Using Amazo{n's} expansion to Crystal City, VA as a case study, we analyze how local firm{s’} anticipation of this entry affects local innovation. Our results demonstrate that Amazon's expansion positively impacts local innovation activities, highlighting the significance of anticipation in knowledge spillovers.},

  title = {Expert Signaling as an Inclusion-Based Moderation Strategy in Online Health Consultation Community},
  journal = {Project},
  abstract = {Online Health Consultation Communities (OHCCs) connect advice seekers and advice givers on a two-sided, user-generated platform and remain vulnerable to misinformation. We study minimum quality standards (MQS) via expert labeling (clinicians and medical students who can get expert verification on OHCCs) as a credibility signal. Building on MQS theory and a simple game-theoretic framework, we preregister four testable implications: (H1) verified experts will lower jargon density after verification; (H2) verification should increase engagement with expert answers; (H3) the marginal benefit of jargon for engagement should attenuate after labeling; and (H4) experts should display higher epistemic effort (operationalized by citations) and comparable or higher textual effort (word count). Using various difference-in-differences designs on r/AskDocs - a Reddit medical advice community served as our empirical setting, we find: (i) jargon density slightly increases rather than falls (contradicting H1), (ii) engagement (scores and replies) increases after labeling (supporting H2), (iii) the jargon-engagement slope does not attenuate (rejecting H3), and (iv) experts provide more citations but fewer words (partially supporting H4). These results suggest that expert label primarily act through demand-side trust (users reward expert's answers) rather than supply-side simplification of language, and that experts substitute toward higher-quality references instead of longer text. We contribute to content moderation strategy, platform governance, and health online communities by showing how MQS-style labels can raise engagement on both sides of the advice markets - advice seekers and expert advice givers, offering guidance for moderation strategies that balance participation and informational quality in OHCCs.},

  title = {Persuasion as Cheap Talk in High-Stake Environment: A Case of Online Health Consultation Community},
  journal = {Project},
  abstract = {This paper explores the unintended strategic implications of hybrid moderation strategies in Online Health Consultation Communities (OHCCs), focusing specifically on how moderation actions inadvertently shape experts' signaling behaviors. Drawing from signaling theory, we distinguish between explicit costly signals (e.g., verified expert badges) and implicit, rhetorical cheap talks (e.g., expert's use of rhetorical style). To maintain a high standard of quality of advice, community moderators implement hybrid modertaions strategies: combining inclusive moderation (i.e., signaling experts with credentialed badges or ``expert signaling'') and exclusive moderaion (i.e., preserving the rights to answer at the top-level to experts only or ``expert anchoring''). These actions unintentionally to strategically blend costly signals and cheap talks. We theorize that such hybrid moderation strategies influence two critical dimensions of expert engagement: the extensive margin (frequency of participation) and the intensive margin (persuasive richness of responses). Verified experts, granted explicit badges and increased visibility, are incentivized to complement these credentials with softer rhetorical strategies to further differentiate themselves from peers. This interplay adds complexity to the signaling dynamics, raising important theoretical questions regarding information efficiency and clarity.}

%%  title = {The spillover of novel patents},
%%  abstract ={We applied our newly-constructed {patent’s} novelty measurement to estimate the effect of patent novelty on citation. We use the {patent’s} 1,024 document features as control variables for our estimation, which calls for a method that can reduce the dimensions of control variables. Specifically, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP), Double LASSO, and partialing-out LASSO. As our dataset is panel data, we used fixed effects (assignee and month fixed effects) in all of our analyses. All our results are consistent and suggest that novelty has a quadratic relationship with citation. Either too high or too low novelty might not lead to a high number of citations, a proxy for knwoledge spillover.},
